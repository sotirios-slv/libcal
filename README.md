# LibCal

LibCal is used by SLV to manage booking of its meeting rooms and other public spaces. This repo contains scripts to connect to the API and retrieve data to be stored in a database. This database can then be queried by Power BI to present the data in a useful way.

## Set-up

### Sandbox database

The data is currently stored in an on prem Postgres database called 'Sandbox'. Connection details/credentials are stored in a 1Password vault called 'Strategy & BAD'.

It may be useful to connect to the database using a client that is PostGres compatible. For example  Azure Data Studio requires the 'PostgreSQL' extension - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/postgres-extension?view=sql-server-ver16](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/postgres-extension?view=sql-server-ver16)

Once connected to the database the libcal data is stored in the `public.slv_data` table, which contains data from a variety of other sources too. The 'project' column can be used to identify the records related to LibCal e.g.

```sql
select  *
from public.slv_data
where project = 'libcal'
```

### LibCal API

The LibCal API is authenticated through the use of client credentials. This script uses the existing 'SLV API' app, credentials for which can be found here [https://slv-vic.libcal.com/admin/api/authentication](https://slv-vic.libcal.com/admin/api/authentication). **N.B.** You will need a LibCal admin logon to access this page.

#### .env file

In order to prevent sensitive information (keys, secrets, etc.) being published to GitHub environmental variables have been used. A template `.env` file has been created, simply add the relevant values and rename to `.env` to enable this code to be run locally.

<!-- Todo: In production the values are stored ? -->
